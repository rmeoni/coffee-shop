# First Release

Welcome to the first release of my Coffee Shop app! This project was built using the Design Thinking methodology, starting with both qualitative and quantitative research to define user personas and uncover pain points. A User Journey Map helped guide the ideation process, followed by the creation of wireframes and a prototype in Figma. The website was then developed using React, and it is still under active development.
